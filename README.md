üç™ The world's most annoying Cookie Consent built while learning essential JavaScript concepts through Frontend Developer Bootcamp on Scrimba.

## About the project

HTML & CSS starting files were provided by Scrimba. The JavaScript part was coded by me.

While working on this project via Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path, I learned/practiced some of the very important JavaScript concepts:

- `setTimeout`
- `element.style`
- forms
- `formData` & `.get()`
- `event.preventDefault`
- CSS: `row-reverse`
- toggling classes
- `disabled` attribute
